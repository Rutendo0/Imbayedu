## Complete Conversation Summary
The user reported that furniture detail pages for IDs 22, 23, 24, and 25 were showing "Furniture Not Found" errors when accessed via URLs like http://localhost:3000/furniture/22. The issue was identified as a data synchronization problem between two components in the furniture system.

**Initial Problem Analysis:**
I investigated the furniture routing system and discovered that the application uses a Next.js dynamic route structure with `app/furniture/[id]/page.tsx` that renders a `FurnitureDetail` component. The component contained hardcoded furniture data that only went up to ID 21, while the user was trying to access IDs 22-25.

**Root Cause:**
The `FurnitureDetail.tsx` component had a `furnitureItems` array that only contained 21 items (IDs 1-21), but the `FurnitureCatalog.tsx` component already had items 22-25 defined. This created a mismatch where users could see furniture items 22-25 in the catalog but couldn't view their detail pages.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Data Synchronization**: I updated the `FurnitureDetail.tsx` component to include the missing furniture items (IDs 22-25) by copying the exact data structure from the `FurnitureCatalog.tsx` component.

2. **Added Four New Furniture Items:**
   - ID 22: "Modern Dining Chair Set" - Contemporary seating with premium upholstery ($1,200)
   - ID 23: "Executive Dining Table" - Sophisticated dining table with brass details ($3,800)
   - ID 24: "Contemporary Stools" - Adjustable height stools with swivel function ($850)
   - ID 25: "Outdoor Patio Set" - Weather-resistant patio furniture ($2,400)

3. **Image Verification**: I verified that all referenced furniture images existed in the `/public/img/furniture/` directory to ensure proper display.

**Technical Details:**
- The furniture data is currently hardcoded in both components rather than being fetched from a database
- Each furniture item includes comprehensive details: name, category, price, description, images array, dimensions, materials, colors, stock status, featured status, and additional details (weight, assembly, care instructions)
- The components use a find operation to locate furniture by ID: `furnitureItems.find(item => item.id === parseInt(String(idStr ?? "0"), 10))`

**Files Modified:**
- Updated `components/pages/FurnitureDetail.tsx` to add the four missing furniture items with complete data structures matching the catalog component

**Current Status:**
The issue has been resolved. All furniture URLs (including /furniture/22, /furniture/23, /furniture/24, and /furniture/25) should now work properly and display the correct furniture details instead of the "Furniture Not Found" error.

**Important Insights for Future Work:**
1. **Data Consistency**: The codebase has duplicate furniture data arrays in multiple components that need to be kept in sync manually
2. **Refactoring Opportunity**: Consider extracting furniture data to a shared data source or API to prevent future synchronization issues
3. **Database Integration**: The current hardcoded approach should eventually be replaced with a proper database-driven system
4. **Component Architecture**: Both FurnitureDetail and FurnitureCatalog components maintain their own copies of the same data, which is prone to inconsistencies
