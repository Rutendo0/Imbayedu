## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation addressed two main issues in the Imbayedu Art Collective website: missing furniture items causing "Furniture Not Found" errors and broken images on the interior design page.

**Initial Problem**: The user reported that furniture URLs for IDs 22, 23, 24, and 25 were returning "Furniture Not Found" errors, indicating these items didn't exist in the furniture data.

**Root Cause Analysis**: Investigation revealed that the FurnitureDetail component had hardcoded furniture data that only went up to ID 21, while the FurnitureCatalog component already had items 22-25 but with different data. This inconsistency between components was causing the 404 errors.

**Primary Solution - Furniture Items**: 
- Updated the FurnitureDetail component to include the missing furniture items (IDs 22-25)
- Synchronized the data between FurnitureDetail and FurnitureCatalog components to ensure consistency
- Added proper furniture items: Modern Dining Chair Set (ID 22), Executive Dining Table (ID 23), Contemporary Stools (ID 24), and Outdoor Patio Set (ID 25)
- All referenced images were verified to exist in the public/img/furniture directory

**Secondary Issue - Interior Design Images**: During the conversation, the user also reported broken images on the interior design page. Several image path issues were identified and fixed:
- Updated background image path from incorrect filename to correct one
- Fixed "Custom Furniture" image path
- Fixed "Marbella Villa" image path  
- Corrected "Artistic Vibes" image path
- Fixed "Warm Artistry" image path with filename typo
- Updated "Residential Design" image path
- Removed duplicate images in the project gallery and replaced them with new unique images

**Image Management**: The solution involved careful verification of image file existence and updating multiple image references throughout the InteriorDesign component. All new image paths were tested to ensure they exist in the public directory.

**Technical Approach**: The fix required maintaining data consistency across multiple components while ensuring all image references were valid. The furniture data structure includes comprehensive details like dimensions, materials, colors, pricing, and care instructions.

**Current Status**: All furniture detail pages (22-25) now work correctly, displaying proper furniture information with valid images. The interior design page displays all images correctly without duplicates. The website's furniture catalog and detail pages are now fully functional and synchronized.

**Future Considerations**: This issue highlights the importance of centralizing furniture data to avoid inconsistencies between components. Consider implementing a shared data source or API for furniture items to prevent similar issues in the future.
